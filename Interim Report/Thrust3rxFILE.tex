\subsubsection{Detailed problem statement}Receiver-side mitigation of spectral artifact noise. \textcolor{red} {[$\Box$  combine  paper \#1:  Receiver cancellation of radar in radio + paper \#2:  Subsampling in Receiver Cancellation\hspace{3mm} add more details.  -- use the new radar ref book?}\par
This work addresses interference cancellation in \mbox{SSPARC} systems, extending receiver-based interference cancellation techniques developed for an interfering communications source.  Algorithms are further developed and implemented for communications receivers to reduce the effects of nonlinear interference due to an interfering radar transmitter.  \textcolor{red}{present tense?}

As described below, we demonstrate in post-processing how a communications receiver can use information about a radar transmission to estimate the adjacent band spectral leakage from the radar.  Once the leakage signal is estimated, it is subtracted from the communications signal thereby improving the communication system performance.  We quantify this performance improvement through simulations, based on measured data.  To ensure realism, power amplifier measurements are performed to capture the spectral broadening, \emph{i.e.}, to characterize and model the interference due to nonlinear effects at the transmitter.  This interference is out-of-band with respect to the radar, but in-band for the communications receiver.  The measured data is post-processed to analyze the performance of receiver-based algorithms to cancel radar interference.  Results are quantified in terms of performance improvement versus separation in frequency and distance between the desired communications signal and radar interferer.  Additional background is included in \cite{tokuda2014canc}.\par
Following \cite{Omer}, reporting a method to cancel spectral self-interference, \textit{i.e.}, the nonlinear spectral expansion of the transmitter in a full-duplex cellular handset.  In this method, the transmitter's out-of-band distortion is estimated, reconstructed based on a model of the power amplifier nonlinearity, then subtracted at the receiver \cite{Omer}.  This technique can be extended to a distant receiver assuming the required side information is available at the receiver.

\textit{Power Amplifier Models}:
Interference cancellation techniques rely on accurate models of the power amplifier.  Recent trends in power amplifier modeling  \cite{ZhuSimpl, Ding, Raich, Zhuprune} favor variations of a Volterra model \par
%\begin{flushright}

\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^K\int\dots\int h_k( \boldsymbol{\tau_k})\prod_{i=1}^kx(t-\tau_i)d \boldsymbol{\tau_k}
\end{equation}
%\end{flushright}
where $y(t)$ and $x(t)$ are the output and input of the power amplifier, respectively, $K$ is nonlinear order, $t$ is time, and $\tau_i$ represents delay.  
The terms $h_k(\boldsymbol{\tau_k})$ are the Volterra coefficients \cite{Zhuprune}.  Special cases of the Volterra model have been considered to reduce computational complexity, for example,  memory polynomials, representing the diagonal terms of the Volterra model \cite{Ding}.  \par
The main disadvantage of the Volterra model is that its characterization requires a large number of coefficients.  Furthermore, the accuracy of this approach may be degraded if the system of coefficient equations is ill-conditioned, leading to significant changes in output results for relatively small fluctuations in the input data.  Memory polynomials, while simpler in form, have similar issues.  In \cite{Raich}, this is addressed by creating orthogonal polynomial basis functions in the signal sample space, leading to better convergence and improved numerical stability. 

\textit{Mathematical Set-up for Matrix Sub-Sampling}:  
Given a specific power amplifier model, we can represent the transmitted signal $\boldsymbol{y}$, a column vector of N collected samples, as 
\begin{equation} \label{eqyAc}
\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{Ac},
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{A}$ is an N x K matrix of memory monomial terms with maximum order K and $\boldsymbol{c}$ is a K x 1 vector of coefficients.  The objective of power amplifier modeling is to find $\boldsymbol{c}$ in Eq. \ref{eqyAc}, characterizing the nonlinearities of the amplifier. 

The channel,  receive filter, and receiver noise may be included as
\begin{equation}\label{eqyFrxh}
\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{F}_{Rx}\boldsymbol{F}_h\boldsymbol{Ac} + \boldsymbol{n},
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{F}_{Rx}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}_h$ represent convolution matrices for the receive filter and channel, respectively, and $\boldsymbol{n}$ is an N x 1 vector of AWGN samples.  In this form, downsampling may be implemented by deleting corresponding rows of $\boldsymbol{y}$, the product matrix $\boldsymbol{F}_{Rx}\boldsymbol{F}_h\boldsymbol{A}$, and $\boldsymbol{n}$.  \textcolor{red}{\fbox{?} add Bob's pptx cartoon in tikz?}

\textcolor{red}{Revise and find a place for this intro section}\\Sub-band sampling is a technique to reduce the required measurement bandwidth at the receiver, thereby enabling applications to wider bandwidth signals.  It can also reduce computational complexity.   Initial measurements were performed with 25x oversampling to ensure accuracy and to capture short term memory effects.  A long measurement interval is also desired to ensure observations of representative behavior, and to capture long term memory effects.  These guidelines can lead to very large sample sets, and correspondingly high computational complexity.  Depending on the computational approach, the calculation of the psuedoinverse of a very large matrix containing all the measured samples, could be a limiting factor impeding successful construction of a nonlinear model.  Hence, sub-sampling, a technique that results in less data by sampling at lower rates, is of interest to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing model accuracy.  Sub-sampling can also be applied to a targeted spectral range, i.e., to extract a model from a limited bandwidth, a sub-band of the full spectrum.
  
Using a ``puncturing matrix'' $\boldsymbol{P}$ to represent the operation of deleting rows, this becomes										\begin{equation}\label{eqPy}
\boldsymbol{Py} = \boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{F}_{Rx}\boldsymbol{F}_h\boldsymbol{Ac}) + \boldsymbol{Pn},
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{P}$ is a puncturing operator that deletes specified lines in a matrix or vector.

In conventional signal processing, where the goal is to reconstruct an analog signal based on discrete samples, Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem dictates that the sampling rate be twice the highest frequency of the signal bandwidth\cite{Liu96Spec}.  In many applications of power amplifier modeling, \textit{e.g.}, analog predistortion, the output nonlinearities have significant spectral content extending to six times the input signal bandwidth\cite{Park02Adap}.  Hence, for wideband applications, the required sampling rates can be quite high.  To illustrate, input and output signals are shown in Fig. \ref{fig_Nyquist}, with a sampling frequency pictorially represented in each case so that the signal and its image do not overlap.  However, in this work, the goal is to model the power amplifier nonlinearities; it is not necessary to reconstruct the information-bearing signal.   In this case, we expect to be able to sample below the output Nyquist rate, and possibly given certain circumstances, even below the input Nyquist rate

\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced Sampling Rate:  As the sampling rate is reduced, the specifications on the anti-aliasing filters may become more stringent.  Furthermore, as the sampling period increases, we may not be able to characterize short term memory effects, \emph{i.e.}, insufficient temporal resolution may impede the capture of memory effects.  However, clearly reduction in computational complexity can be realized, simply by reducing the amount of oversampling.
\item Undersampling:  According to the Generalized Sampling Theorem, a nonlinear system can be characterized accurately when the output signal is sampled at the \emph{input} Nyquist rate\cite{Tsimbinos94}.  In \cite{Park02Adap}, up to 133\% overlap in output spectra is allowed and ... \textcolor{red}{\fbox{.} add JSK Joon results.}   In other words, sampling below Nyquist rate is acceptable because we don't need to fully reconstruct the signal.  Furthermore, we may be able to relax the antialiasing filter requirements, because the out-of-band nonlinear distortion that we are concerned with, is typically 40 - 60 dB below the in-band spectra, so the presence of aliased images of the distortion, should not affect our signal. 
\item Targeted sub-band sampling:  Since our objective is to cancel nonlinear radar interference affecting a communications signall, in principle, we only need to model a relatively narrow bandwidth in the spectral neighborhood of a communications signal.  This is generally a significantly small bandwidth than the entire radar bandwidth plus spectral splatter.  Since the model only needs to be valid for a limited bandwidth, the sampling rate can be reduced further.  In this case, the Generalized Nyquist Theorem states that the sampling frequency only needs to be twice as large as the bandwidth of interest.  Furthermore, by judicious selection of the sampling frequency, we may be able to  characterize the image of the signal to extract our model using a significantly lower sampling rate.
\item Swept sampling:  If reducing the sampling rate obscures important memory effects, it may be possible to inplement a nonuniform sampling rate to capture short timescale events but keep the number of samples low.  An offset sampling technique might also capture memory effects while allowing a low sampling rate.

\subsubsection{Analytical/Simulation Results}
\subsubsection{Lab results}

Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the measurement test bed with a photo of the actual setup.  The test bed consists of a National Instruments PXIe-8130 Embedded Controller, two PXIe-5663 6.6-GHz RF vector signal analyzers (RFSAs) with 50-MHz instantaneous bandwidth, a PXIe-5673 6.6-GHz RF vector signal generator (RFSG) with 100-MHz instantaneous bandwidth, and an HP E4433B signal generator  (ESG).  Measurements are automated in LabVIEW.  Using this setup, a wideband interferer and a desired signal are represented as band-limited AWGN, a scenario typically considered to be “worst case.”  The device under test, for the dataset presented below, is a high-power Class AB power amplifier optimized for a carrier frequency of 2.14 GHz.

\textit{Measurement Procedure: }
Referring to Fig. 1, a wideband signal is generated by the RFSG and amplified by the power amplifier; this signal represents interference from a distant radar transmitter.  A narrowband signal is generated by the ESG, representing a lower power communications signal, \emph{i.e.}, the desired signal.  The input and reference output of the power amplifier, and the combined signal (power amplifier output plus narrowband lower power signal) are measured for post-processing.

\textit{Post-Processing Procedure:}
Using the measured input and reference output containing only the wideband amplified interference signal, coefficients  $h_k( \boldsymbol{\tau_k})$ for a Volterra model are determined as in (1).  Delay is parameterized by a maximum memory length M, \emph{i.e.}, the longest delay is represented by M\hspace{1pt}\textendash\hspace{0.25pt}1 sampling steps.  \OMP are also considered.  For either case, once the parameters of the model are determined through measurements and subsequent post-processing, the extracted model is used to generate an estimate of the adjacent-band spectral expansion.  This cancellation signal is subtracted from the received signal in simulations, to improve \SINR at the receiver.  In this manner, post-processing of measured data and simulated interference cancellation is used to determine performance as a function of varying RF frequency offset between the desired signal and the interferer.  Receiver \SINR is presented versus both the distance between the interferer and the receiver, and the receiver \SNR.

\textit{Measurements:}
Measured data for the input and reference interference output of the power amplifier, \emph{i.e.}, without the desired signal, is shown in Fig. 2 for an input power of 10 dBm.  To show a higher level of distortion, measured data for the input and output of the power amplifier plus the desired signal is shown in Fig. 3 for an input power of 12 dBm.

Each model is used to generate an estimate of the nonlinear interference.  The difference signal equal to ``output \textendash\hspace{1pt} estimated'' is shown in Fig. 2, for an input power, $P_{in}$, of 10 dBm, without the desired signal. This difference estimates the improvement due to interference cancellation, as if a desired signal were present.  Similar traces are shown in Fig. 3 for a $P_{in}$ of 12 dBm, however, in this case, the ``output'' contains the desired signal plus the interference.  The \SINR may be obtained from an average of the desired signal level and an average of the signal level adjacent to the desired signal.  For example, the \SINR of the desired signal before post-processing of the output signal (red curve), is $\sim$ 4 dB.  After interference cancellation  (black curve), the \SINR of the desired signal is $\sim$ 22 dB, representing $\sim$ 18 dB of interference suppression.\par
Fig. 4 compares the performance of the OMP and the Volterra model in a plot showing interference suppression, over a frequency offset range of 2.5 MHz \textendash\hspace{0.25pt} 7.5 MHz, where each plotted point represents an average over a 0.5-MHz bandwidth.    The OMP uses order K = 12 and  memory length M = 7 and the Volterra uses K = 5 and M = 4.  These models show the same trends for the different power levels shown.  Increasing the input power level causes more distortion; this increase in distortion leads to an increase in cancellation improvement.  Although the Volterra model achieves similar performance with lower order and memory length, it requires 1364 coefficients while the  OMP only requires 84 coefficients, representing a large increase in computational load and/or lookup table size.  \par
Fig. 5 is a contour plot showing distortion improvement as a function of model order and memory length for an OMP corresponding to a 3.5-MHz offset.  This figure illustrates that increased modeling does not necessarily lead to better results, indicated by regions where increasing order or memory length does not improve performance.  
In Figs. 6 and 7, the estimated model is used to relate interference suppression to \SINR and distance using a simple path loss model, as a function of varying amounts of AWGN at the receiver, \emph{i.e.}, versus receiver \SNR.  Figs. 6 and 7 show the data before and after interference cancellation, respectively.  By inspection of Fig. 6, without distortion correction, given a receiver \SNR of $\sim$ 21dB, a receiver target \SINR of 20 dB can be achieved when the radar is 300 km away from the receiver.  From Fig. 7, after distortion correction, the radar can be as near as $\sim$ 90 km, and maintain the same target \SINR of 20 dB and \SNR of $\sim$ 21 dB.  

\subsection{Outlook and remaining work}
The results reported above show performance improvements due to cancellation of radar interference by a communications receiver and encourages further measurements and analyses.  
The measured and post-processed data indicate non-optimized performance improvements of up to $\sim$ 18-dB interference suppression, which corresponds to a significant reduction in radar-communications separation.  Further work is necessary to include realistic system blocks, such as channel models, and radar power amplifiers.\par
Based on preliminary measurements and post-processing, radar interference cancellation by a communications receiver is a promising topic for further research relevant to SSPARC.
Extension to wider sampling bandwidths would improve the overall model and enable wider bandwidth applications.  Radar channel models and measurements of high power radar amplifiers are essential to customize the estimation model.  Decision-directed cancellation techniques or other enhancements could be implemented to improve performance as well \cite{Gregorio}.  \par
Practical considerations and increased realism in scenarios might include consideration of constraints on amounts of side information, delayed side information, and computational load.  Future work on variations of receiver cancellation of nonlinear distortion, could include cooperation or collaboration from the transmitter, \emph{e.g.}, predistortion or notching specified bandwidths to enhance interference cancellation.
Going forward to mitigate radar out-of-band interference to communications radios.\\  \vskip 1mm
